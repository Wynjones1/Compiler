Each subdirectory contains a self-contained test.

The file structure is as follows.
    main.x         - the test to run.
    returncode.txt - contains the expected return code of the program
    stderr.txt     - contains the expected stderr of the program
    stdout.txt     - contains the expected stdout of the program

To add a new test you can run add_test.sh
